# Lutheme: My dream theme for Blueprint!
# This is still on beta! If you have feedback DM me on discord (lucas11.xyz) or make a Github issue! 
## Why did i make this?
Basicly the issue i had in the normal theme for pterodactyl is that is hard to customize without modding but i wanted a custom theme for my home server. 
Then i got this idea a few months later, but i was scared to code it as i never used php. Untill now i had the motivation to finish this.
## How to install
Download the [.blueprint file in releses](https://github.com/lucas11222/lutheme/releases/download/0.1-beta/lutheme.blueprint) and install this with this command:
```bash
blueprint install lutheme
```
