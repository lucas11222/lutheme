# Lutheme: My dream theme for Blueprint!
## Why?
I had an issue with the standard Pterodactyl theme. It was hard to customize without modding, but I wanted to use a custom theme for my homeserver. I got this idea a few months earlier, but I delayed work on it as I've never coded in PHP. Though, now I had enough motivation to finish this. Thanks for reading :)

## Installation
Download the `lutheme.blueprint` file in the GitHub release, drop it in your `/var/www/pterodactyl` directory and run the following command:

```bash
blueprint install lutheme
```
